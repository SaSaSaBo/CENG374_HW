                    <p>KUTLUCA KÖPRÜSÜ: The 25-meter-long historical Roman Bridge, also known as Taşköprü or Kutluca Bridge, was built from smooth cut block stones. German Karl Dörner, who conducted research in Kocaeli in 1940, determined that the building was built during the reign of Emperor Claudius by looking at its architectural features. The masonry and arch technique of the 7-arched and 5-arched bridge, dating back to the first century AD, are remarkable.</p>
